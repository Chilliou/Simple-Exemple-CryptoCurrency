# Sample Code
*This is a greatly simplified example*
## 1.0 How a block works ?
We have the first block created from a transaction between X users \
From these transations the first block is created which generates a hash:907f7a1145941f084f8ef474a0868b3bdc12bc8d74a784f18921f22f779e34b8 \
We repeat the operation with the same hash as the previous one, which shows how blocks work in the cryptocurrency world

## 2.0 How blockchain works ?
As its name suggests, blockchain is a chain of blocks \
So we don't have to enter any hashes, everything is automatically managed \
Each user makes x number of transations, which are then registered in the blockchain, making them immutable

## 3.0 Possible improvement 
* Add users with different currencies to exchange RatonCoins regularly
* Make block take X transaction then move on to the next one
